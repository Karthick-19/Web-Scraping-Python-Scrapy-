# Web-Scraping-Python-Scrapy-
The Web Scraping Project using Python Scrapy Module is a Python-based web scraping tool that allows users to extract product details and reviews for a specific search keyword from multiple e-commerce websites. This project leverages the power of Scrapy, a popular web crawling and scraping library, to automate the data collection process.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these instructions:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: Python Downloads

Usage
Open the settings.py file to set up your preferred configurations, such as user-agent, download delays, and other Scrapy settings.

In the spiders folder, locate the product_spider.py file. This spider contains the logic to scrape the product details and reviews.
